WORK SPLIT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
We never explicitly determined Partner A and Partner B, nor did we
explicitly split the work for any part. We also did a lot of
cross-checking and helping each other write their parts, so we can't
really determine where the work split comes.

BUGS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Although our interpreter works for arbitrarily long tail recursions,
it does not work for arbitrariliy long lists of arguments. This is
because the structure of scm_read() lends itself to be recursive for
every argument. Therefore, our interpreter cannot handle more than
~900 arguments, and fewer depending on the recursion
limits. Therefore, the autograder testing will not pass with some of
the stress tests we introduced in our tests.scm file. This is not
necessarily a bug but more a flaw in design that would require major
refactoring to fix.
